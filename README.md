# Nightly Tester Tools
Nightly Tester Tools is an addon for aiding testers of nightly builds of Mozilla apps like Firefox and Thunderbird. Some features are:

* Extension compatibility fixing
* Titlebar customization
* Build ID retrieval
* Copy extension list to clipboard
* Screenshots
* Open Profile Folder

# Install
You can install the latest stable NTT from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6543/). To install for development, clone the repo:

	git clone git://github.com/mozilla/nightlytt.git

then add a file titled '{8620c15f-30dc-4dba-a131-7c5d20cf4a29}' to the "extensions" directory in your [profile folder](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder) with the text:

	~/nightlytt/

or whatever the path to your nightlytt folder is.

[Download the binary components](https://github.com/downloads/mozilla/nightlytt/platform.zip) and unzip, there should be a `'platform'` directory at the top level of the extension after unzipping. These binaries are necessary for the crash-forcing feature to work.

To bundle the extension into an xpi for distribution, run this command to get a `nightlytt.xpi` file:

```
cd extension; zip -r ../nightlytt.xpi * -x@../zipexclude.lst; cd ..
```
